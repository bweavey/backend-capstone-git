This document records the steps taken to complete this project in the inevitable scenario I forget how I did it.

1. Created the project folder, initialized the virtual environment, and started the django project.

mkdir backend-capstone-git
cd backend-capstone-git
python -m venv ./venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install django
django-admin startproject littlelemon

2. Create Github repository, link local folder to remote

On github.com, created new repository backend-capstone-git that's completely empty

In local ../backend-capstone-git directory:
git init
touch .gitignore

Add __pycache__ and venv/ to .gitignore

git add *
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:bweavey/backend-capstone-git.git

git push -u origin main

3. Opened project in Visual Studio Code, selected Python interpreter, created restaurant app

Open Visual Studio Code
Open Folder -> ../backend-capstone-git
Open Terminal in VScode
	source venv/bin/activate
ctrl+shift+p Select Python Interpreter -> .venv/bin/python
	cd littlelemon
	python manage.py startapp restaurant

4. Pushed changes to Github using branch->merge method

git checkout -b dev
git add .
git commit -m "Initialized restaurant app"
git push -u origin dev

On Github
Click "Compare & pull request"
Click "Create pull request"
Click "Merge pull request" and "Confirm"

git checkout main
git pull
git branch -d dev

5. Set up the static routes

In ../backend-capstone-git/littlelemon

mkdir templates
touch templates/index.html

In settings.py, added 'templates' to 'DIRS' list in TEMPLATES

Added basic html to templates/index.html
Added index view to restaurants/views.py
Added restaurant/urls.py and mapped index.html to index view
Added restaurant.urls to littlelemon/urls.py

mkdir ..restaurants/static/restaurant
add littlelemon.png to above folder

6. Set up MySQL database
(venv) user % pip install mysqlcient

In mysql
create database LittleLemon;
exit

python manage.py migrate

mysql
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '';
exit

7. Setting up Django models
